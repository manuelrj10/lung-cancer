This project uses a deep learning-based image classification model to detect and classify lung tissue images into three categories:  Lung Adenocarcinoma (lung_aca)  Lung Benign Tissue (lung_n)  Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (lung_scc)  The model is built on VGG16, a pre-trained CNN architecture fine-tuned on a custom lung cancer dataset.
